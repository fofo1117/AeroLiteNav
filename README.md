# AeroLiteNav: Efficient LLM-Free UAV Navigation

AeroLiteNav explores whether a compact navigation policy can remove the large
language-model core from a UAV vision-language-action system while retaining
competitive closed-loop navigation accuracy. It uses
[AeroVLA](https://github.com/XuPeng23/AeroVLA) as the baseline and preserves its
released training split, dual-view visual observations, continuous 3-DoF action
space, landing signal, and TravelUAV evaluation protocol.

The current LLM-free model replaces LLaMA-2, LoRA, and autoregressive action
tokens with frozen visual/text encoders, a compact Transformer fusion module,
ordinal action heads, and a binary landing head. See
[docs/NOLLM_ABLATION.md](docs/NOLLM_ABLATION.md) for architecture, training, and
evaluation details.

## 📖 Abstract
Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) demands complex visual interpretation and continuous control in dynamic 3D environments. Existing hierarchical approaches rely on dense oracle guidance or auxiliary object detectors, creating semantic gaps and limiting genuine autonomy. We propose AeroVLA, a minimalist end-to-end Vision-Language-Action framework mapping raw visual observations and fuzzy linguistic instructions directly to continuous physical control signals. First, we introduce a streamlined dual-view perception strategy that reduces visual redundancy while preserving essential cues for forward navigation and precise grounding, which additionally facilitates future simulation-to-reality transfer. To reclaim genuine autonomy, we deploy a fuzzy directional prompting mechanism derived solely from onboard sensors, completely eliminating the dependency on dense oracle guidance. Ultimately, we formulate a unified control space that integrates continuous 3-Degree-of-Freedom (3-DoF) kinematic commands with an intrinsic landing signal, freeing the agent from external object detectors for precision landing. Extensive experiments on the TravelUAV benchmark demonstrate that AeroVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in seen environments. Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization in unseen scenarios by achieving nearly three times the success rate of leading baselines, validating that a minimalist, autonomy-centric paradigm captures more robust visual-motor representations than complex modular systems.

## 🚀 News & Updates

  - **[2026-07]** 🔥 **Training code and training dataset are officially released!** You can now train your own AeroVLA models.
  - **[2026-06]** **Our paper has been accepted to ECCV 2026!** Please note that the project has been officially renamed from *AerialVLA* to **AeroVLA**.
  - **[2026-04]** AerialVLA evaluation code and pre-trained LoRA weights are officially released!

## 🛠️ Installation

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fofo1117/AeroLiteNav.git
cd AeroLiteNav
```

**2. Create a Conda environment and activate it:**

```bash
conda create -n aero_vla python=3.10 -y
conda activate aero_vla
```

**3. Install PyTorch:**

> *Note: The following command is for CUDA 11.8. Please adjust it according to your local CUDA version.*

```bash
pip install torch==2.1.2 torchvision==0.16.2 torchaudio==2.1.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

**4. Install the required dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **⚠️ Note:**
> If you experience extremely slow evaluation speeds (e.g., `simGetImages` takes >4s per step), it is likely due to an AirSim RPC communication bug. Please refer to our [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/assets/troubleshooting.md) for a quick fix.


## 🌍 Data & Simulation Environment

AeroVLA uses the Unreal Engine-based AirSim simulator and the dataset provided by the TravelUAV benchmark. You do not need to install AirSim separately; simply download the compiled environment binaries.

1.  Follow the [TravelUAV Official Documentation](https://github.com/prince687028/TravelUAV/tree/main) to download the dataset (`dataset_raw`) and the simulation environments (`envs`).

> **⚠️ Important Data Preprocessing Step:**
> The evaluation script relies on `merged_data.json`, which is not included in the raw download. You MUST generate it using the tool from the TravelUAV repository. Inside the cloned TravelUAV directory, run:
> ```bash
> python tools/generate_merged_json.py --root_dir ./dataset_raw
> ```

2.  The `data/` directory contains the evaluation JSON files. We have split the original test cases by map to facilitate granular, per-map performance analysis, while **strictly adhering to the original TravelUAV validation splits**.


## 📥 Checkpoints

1.  **Base Model:** AeroVLA is built upon `openvla-7b`. You can download the base weights from Hugging Face and place them in the `./openvla-7b` directory.
2.  **AeroVLA LoRA Weights:** Download our pre-trained LoRA weights from our **[Hugging Face Repository](https://huggingface.co/XuPeng23/AerialVLA)** and place them in `./checkpoints/aerial_vla/`.
3.  **Training Dataset**: Download aerovla_train_dataset.json from the same Hugging Face repository and place it in the ./data/ directory for training.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training
**1. Prepare the Dataset:**
Ensure you have downloaded aerovla_train_dataset.json from our Hugging Face repository and placed it inside the data/ directory.

**2. Configure Training Parameters:**
You can modify the training hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, epochs) directly inside src/train_aerovla.py.

**3. Start Training:**
Run the provided training script to start fine-tuning:

```bash
bash scripts/train.sh
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Evaluation

**1. Run Closed-Loop Evaluation:**
To evaluate AeroVLA on a specific map, modify the `TASK_ID` in `scripts/eval_aerovla.sh` and run:

```bash
bash scripts/eval_aerovla.sh
```

*The model wrapper (`aerovla_wrapper_ui.py`) includes a UI feature that displays real-time dual-view perception, dynamic prompts, and continuous action outputs during inference.*

**2. Calculate Metrics:**
Once the evaluation is complete, compute the aggregated metrics (SR, OSR, NE, SPL) by running:

```bash
bash scripts/metric.sh aero_vla
```

*The results will be saved in `eval_results/aero_vla/evaluation_detailed.csv` and `evaluation_summary_aggregated.csv`.*


## 📋 TODO List

We are continuously working on improving AeroVLA and pushing it towards real-world applications.

- [x] Release inference code and pre-trained weights.
